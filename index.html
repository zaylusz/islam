      <div class="title">The Spread of Islam: A Narrative Summary</div>
      <p>
        Islam emerged in the early 7th century in the Arabian Peninsula with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.
        The religion quickly spread throughout the region, starting in Mecca and Medina, and expanding across the Middle East, North Africa, and into Europe and Asia. 
        By the time of the Prophet's death in 632 CE, much of the Arabian Peninsula had embraced Islam.
        Under the Caliphs, the religion continued to spread, reaching as far as Spain in the west and India in the east. 
        Conquests, trade, and missionary efforts played a role in the widespread adoption of Islam.
        The Islamic empire introduced significant advancements in science, mathematics, and culture, influencing many aspects of the ancient world. 
        The religion remains one of the largest in the world today, with over a billion followers.
